This is sexyPSF, based off of pcsx and peops.

To compile, go to the main directory, and type "make", if you're 
running on an x86(IA32) system.
If you want to compile for a generic LSB-first(ARM, IA32, AMD64, etc.), do 
"make CPU=LSBFIRST".  For a generic MSB-first(PowerPC) platform,
do "make CPU=MSBFIRST".

You can then do "make install" to install it to ~/.xmms/Plugins

(Replace "make" with "gmake" if necessary in the above commands)

You need to have zlib installed, as well as the xmms plugin header file(s).

***** IMPORTANT *****
The minimum CPU this will run on at real time is probably a Pentium MMX 
200MHz CPU.
You should change the "-mcpu=i686" string in the makefile, if necessary,
to better suit your processor.  This may be *necessary* for correct code
generation on your platform in certain cases.  For example, if you're using
a Pentium 1, just have "-mcpu=i586".

There might be exploitable bugs in the emulation and PSF loading code.  I know
there are bugs that can cause a segmentation fault for deferencing NULL 
pointers, in the emulation code.  To be most safe, only play PSFs from trusted
sources(and trusted rippers).
