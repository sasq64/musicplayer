- Something?

The old TODO list that I(xodnizel) will be unable to do:

- Implement filter to match frequency response of a real PSX, and maybe
do compression.
- Reorganize source code tree, and add PSF2 support.
- Add support for the "volume" PSF tag?  Maybe, but I don't think it's very useful...
- Add configuration, file info, about dialogs.  A GTK+2 version of xmms would 
be nice...bah.
